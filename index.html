                <h3>Removing construction dust and debris</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The task of taking out <b>construction dust and debris</b> is vital. Dust can fill the air and settle on every surface after renovation work. It’s <b>not safe to breathe in this dust</b>. You should <b>use a broom or vacuum to clean up the big bits</b>.</li>
                    <li>Use a wet cloth for finer dust particles on window sills, walls and floors. For hard-to-reach areas, you may need special tools or ladders. All waste like wood pieces, nails, paper or plastic must be thrown away safely in bags or bins.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Eliminating harmful chemicals and residue</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>After a house or HDB flat renovation, harmful chemicals may stick around. These can be on walls, floors or other surfaces. Some are left from paint, glue and other building materials. They must be removed for the safety of all people living in the home.</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Restoring cleanliness and hygiene</h3>

                    <li>After a home renovation, dust and dirt can be all over. It is best to do a deep clean. This brings back the clean feel of your home. You start by getting rid of all the debris left from the building work.</li>

                    <li>Using right cleaning tools helps remove stubborn stains or sticky residue on walls and floors. Clean air vents and filters help keep away dust that can harm healthy living space inside homes in Singapore.</li>

            <section>
                <p>To begin the post renovation cleaning process, you should first prepare by gathering all necessary cleaning supplies and tools.</p>
                <h3>Prepare for cleaning</h3>
                <p>First, you need to get ready for cleaning. Put on gloves and a mask to keep safe from dust and dirt. Pick up any large bits of trash and toss them in the bin. Use a broom to sweep up smaller bits.</p>
                <p>Open all doors and windows to let fresh air in. This is an important step for post renovation cleaning in Singapore homes or hdb flats. It helps make the later steps of dusting, vacuuming, and deep cleaning easier.</p>
                <h3>Dusting and vacuuming</h3>
                <p>Dusting and vacuuming are key steps in post renovation cleaning. Every corner of your home should be dust-free. Use a good quality duster to wipe off the dust from all surfaces, like walls, windows, and furniture.</p>
                <p>Next comes the vacuuming part. This gets rid of any leftover dust or small bits that were missed during the dusting.</p>
                <p>Vacuum every room of your house carefully. Don’t miss out on hidden spots under beds or behind furniture. Be sure to empty the dirt canister frequently as it fills up fast with renovation debris! Also ensure to clean air vents and filters too – they often collect lots of fine dust that’s hard to notice but bad for breathing in.</p>
                <p>With this step done right, your home starts looking fresh again after all that heavy work!</p>
                <h3>Cleaning walls, windows, and fixtures</h3>
                <p>Dirt hides on walls, windows and fixtures after a renovation job. These parts need deep cleaning to sparkle again. A damp cloth can clean dust off the walls. Use soapy water for tougher spots.</p>
                <p>Always start from top to bottom of the wall.</p>
                <p>For windows, make a mix of vinegar and warm water. Spray it on and then wipe it off using a soft cloth or newspaper. This helps in removing smear marks.</p>
                <p>In case of light fixtures, switch them off first for safety. Take them apart gently if you can and use a wet cloth to clean each part.</p>
                <p>Don’t forget door handles and knobs! Polish them with oil or special cleaner till they shine like new items. Cleaning after renovation takes time but gives fresh feelings in your home.</p>
                <h3>Deep cleaning flooring</h3>
                <p>Deep cleaning flooring is a must after any renovation work. Dust and dirt can hide in corners and under rugs. Using professional cleaning tools, scrub the floors until they shine. Be careful with wood or tiles as harsh chemicals can leave stains.</p>
                <p>You might want to mop the floor several times to get all the dust out. Always dry your floors well to avoid slips and falls. Hiring a post-renovation cleaning service in Singapore may save you time and effort on this task if it’s too tough for you.</p>
                <h3>Kitchen and bathroom cleaning</h3>
                <p>To achieve a thoroughly clean and fresh home after renovation, it’s crucial to pay special attention to the kitchen and bathroom cleaning. The kitchen is where you prepare meals, so it needs to be free from any dust or debris that could contaminate your food.</p>
                <p>Wipe down countertops, cabinets, and appliances with a disinfectant cleaner. Don’t forget about the sink and faucet—scrub them well! For the bathroom, start by removing any remaining construction materials like tiles or grout residue.</p>
                <p>Clean the bathtub, toilet bowl, sink, and shower area using appropriate cleaning products. Pay extra attention to mold or mildew buildup in these areas too.</p>
                <h3>Clean air vents and filters</h3>
                <p>After a renovation, it’s important to clean the air vents and filters in your home. Dust and debris from the construction work can get trapped in these areas, affecting the air quality in your living space.</p>
                <p>By cleaning the vents and filters, you can improve the airflow and ensure that you’re breathing in clean air. It’s recommended to hire professional post renovation cleaning services for this task as they have expertise and specialized equipment to thoroughly clean the vents and filters.</p>
                <p>This will help remove any dirt or allergens that may be present, promoting a healthier environment for you and your family.</p>
                <p>In addition, <b>proper ventilation is crucial during the cleaning process</b> to prevent dust particles from spreading throughout your home. By ensuring good ventilation, you can minimize any potential health risks associated with inhaling airborne contaminants after a renovation.</p>
                <h3>Final touches and inspection</h3>
                <p>After completing the post renovation cleaning process, it is essential to give your home those final touches and conduct a thorough inspection for any missed spots. These final steps are crucial in ensuring that your space is completely clean and ready to be used.</p>
                <p>Look out for any remaining dust or debris, check if all surfaces have been properly cleaned, and inspect for any damages caused during the renovation. By paying attention to these details, you can ensure that your home is spotless and in excellent condition after the renovation work.</p>
